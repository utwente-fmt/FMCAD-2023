Note for the generation of new KnownTypes:

- in SystemC known types like sc_signal, sc_fifo and sc_mutex are
  taken as keywords by KaSCPar and put into the AST, i.e. there
  content is not translated

- thus, the implementation classes have to be renamed before and after
  parsing with KaSCPar (e.g., rename sc_fifo to sc_fifox before
  parsing, run KaSCPar and then rename sc_fifox back to sc_fifo in the
  resulting AST file)
  
- GTYPE: is the type that will be replaced when parsing the ast file in SysCIR.
         To create the ast, GTYPE from sc_xxx needs to be convertet first to i.e.
         char to run sc2ast. Then it needs to be converted back
         
- GLENGTH: is the length of the generic data type such as sc_uint<GLENTH>
           TO create the ast file it has to be converted back and forth like
           the GTYPE (i.e. 13 as a unique number in sc_xxx file and ast).
  
- the script create_implemenentation creates the ast implemementation files for
  sc_signal & sc_fifo. 
  There exist 2 different files:
  - sc_xxx.ast.xml: for simple data types such as int, bool, ...
  - sc_xxx_generic.ast.xml: for generic data types such as sc_uint<16>
  -> different ast files are needed because sc2ast creates asts with different
     tree structure
